 <p> The Graduate School of Industrial Studies was established in 1948 by decree No 800/1948 under the surveillance of the Ministry of Education.
 
In 1990 the Graduate School of Industrial Studies in Thessaloniki was renamed into "University of Macedonia Economics and Social Sciences‚Äù.

Originally the Graduate School of Industrial Studies had two Departments (Economical Studies and Business Administration).

Today the University of Macedonia has the following school departments:

In general the aim and the ambition of the Departments of the University is to prepare, in the Economic field, fully qualified scientists, consultants and executives for the public and private sector. Our graduates will be able to cope with the needs of the Greek and International market. In the Social Sciences field the aim of the University is to develop the field with innovative methods for the Greek standards. This is achieved by awarding titles such as Education and Social Policy and Balkan Slavic and Oriental Studies which is closely related to the Economic Studies.

As far as the Music Studies is concerned, the Department is organised in a similar way with the European Music Academies in order to provide its students more than just theoretical knowledge.</p>
